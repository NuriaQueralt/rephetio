Clearly, homozygous mutations associated with p.R401X cause a severe phenotype. However, the range of outcomes is variable, with some patients having an early demise and others living at least into their teenage years. Patients 2 and 3 appear to have a relatively mild phenotype and are the only two individuals in the current cohort who do not carry the p.R401X mutation. Aside from these broad considerations, more detailed genotype-phenotype correlations will be possible only with the detection of further patients. Consistent with the severe presentation of NGLY1 deficiency, NGLY1 is among the 20% of genes in the human genome that are the most intolerant of functional genetic variation in the human population, and we may expect that less extreme mutations than those seen here may also be associated with disease.	disease	variant	NGLY1 deficiency	c.1201A>T (p.R401X)			2017-03-22	Núria Queralt Rosinach	2014-03-20
